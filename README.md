## 🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Serverless Edge Functions
AI: AI-assisted content generation (API-based)
Deployment: Vercel
Version Control: Git & GitHub
## 🧠 Development Approach
This project was built using an AI-assisted, iterative development approach.
AI tools were used to:
Accelerate initial scaffolding
Generate boilerplate code
Explore UI and feature ideas
The following were handled manually:
Application architecture decisions
UI/UX refinement
Debugging build and deployment issues
Vercel deployment configuration
Error handling and fallback behavior
This approach allowed faster prototyping while maintaining full ownership and understanding of the codebase.
## ⚠️ Note on AI Generation
Live AI-powered generation may be temporarily limited due to API quota restrictions.
To demonstrate the system’s output, a sample PDF is provided that represents the structure and style of the generated presentations.
